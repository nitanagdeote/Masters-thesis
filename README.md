## Abstract

In this thesis, a single layer implementation of 
the fast multipole method  for the solution  of
the three dimensional Helmholtz equation is developed.
The cartesian and spherical harmonic  
representations of the free-space Green's function is derived and 
the Kirchhoff integral formulation of the 
solution  to the Helmholtz equation is presented.
Error analyzes are undertaken for single and
multipole cases. It is shown that translation errors
 can be problematic if the distance between subdomain centers is less than a
wavelength.
